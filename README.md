# UBC_CPEN455_Conditional_PixelCNN

This repository contains the course project for UBC CPEN455 Deep Learning, instructed by Renjie Liao.
The goal of this project was to implement and evaluate a Conditional PixelCNN model for image generation and classification tasks.

For a detailed explanation of the method and experiments, please refer to the Course Project Report.
Using this approach, I achieved 88.09% accuracy and 87.99% F1 score on the test dataset, with a Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) below 30, indicating good generative quality.

This project deepened my understanding of generative models and conditional learning techniques.
